# Hi 
- I’m Ronny, a Cloud Solution Architect with over 30 years in the industry - building and delivering software.
- I’m interested in all kinds of interresting stuff, from low-level assembly/building your own Operating System to High Performant scalable and secure cloud native solutions.
- A more specific list would probably include:
  - Security (and boy is that a huge area) 
  - Reverse Engineering 
  - Identity (Azure AAD, B2C, OIDC/Oauth2, MSAL) 
  - Architecture (aka.ms/waf is a good starting point)
  - CPU Architecture and emulating old-school 8-bit machines (give me that Retro feeling) <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wow-i-didnt-expect-so-much-fun-ronny-hansen/>
  - IoT (programming embedded systems, integrating them with sensors and backends)
  - Logging, Monitoring and Insights
  - Application Hosting (Kubernetes, App Services, serverless, Service Fabric, Docker/Containers,..)
  - C#/NET, Blazor, Cross platform UI
  - C++ (The cross platform/cross device story combined with high performance is a compelling story) 
  - Mixed reality (I wish i had a Hololens..)
  - Graphical design, game design, Unity, SDL2
  - Networking (protocols, security, performance)
